## Description

This app is designed to store multiple users and allow each user to have multiple grocery lists. This goes along with the ability to also work with items and their types for each list. This app will be very convenient for you if you want to manage multiple grocery lists and items at a time.

## General

You'll need an Android device with a minimum API level of 21 for this app to work.

When you first open the app, you must register for an account. Afterwards, the item information you manage will be associated with this account. And at the beginning, your account does not have any items and lists. You need to create one or more lists first before you're able to modify them.

You'll frequently see the "Go Back" text throughout the app. You can press this button at any time to go back to the previous page.
